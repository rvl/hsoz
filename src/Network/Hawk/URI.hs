-- | == Single URI Authorization
--
-- There are cases in which limited and short-term access to a
-- protected resource is granted to a third party which does not have
-- access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a
-- protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk** provides
-- limited support for such URIs in the form of a /bewit/ - a URI
-- query parameter appended to the request URI which contains the
-- necessary credentials to authenticate the request.
--
-- Because of the significant security risks involved in issuing such
-- access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests and
-- for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue
-- bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same
-- credentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who
-- issued which credentials.
--
-- In order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not
-- support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within
-- the granted access timeframe.
--
-- This module collects the URI authorization functions in a single
-- module, to mirror the Hawk.uri module of the javascript
-- implementation.
